# Climate Agile Agriculture Trials

Climate change is characterized by increasing volatility in weather patterns, which can manifest in different ways even in locations relatively close to each other. This creates a need for both farmers and the researchers studying agriculture in the developing world to be more “climate-agile” in their practices. Using a dataset of fertilizer trial outcomes in Uganda conducted by partners of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, aWhere constructed a results dashboard that paired the yield data collected over three years with aWhere’s daily weather data for the same period, localized to each trial site at a 5 arc minute resolution.

The resulting dashboard allows researchers to identify high-performing trial sites and treatment types, examine the weather conditions the prevailed in each site during the growing season, and compare with the historical norm weather patterns in those sites to gain insight into how conditions might be expected to change in future. Furthermore, the dashboard is updateable, allowing future uploading of iterations of the same data and real-time monitoring of the status of ongoing trials.

In the example display below, the farmer conducted his trial over 147 days from planting to harvesting during the long rainy season of 2013. His highest grain yield as reported in the AGRA data was only 2.7 tonnes per hectare, one of the lower yields achieved among the trial sites. However, examining the aWhere climate data for his plot showed that he had experienced about 50 mm of accumulated rain over the season, more than double the 3-year norm rainfall for his plot during the equivalent days of the year. This simple example shows the value high-resolution weather data can bring to researchers who seeking to make climate-sensitive conclusions about what treatments work, where they are likely to work, and under what conditions.
